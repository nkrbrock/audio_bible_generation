# audio_bible_generation
The project focused on generating new audio Bibles for revised versions of Biblicaâ€™s Chinese and Spanish Bibles. Both of these projects required a Python script in order to process the text files so that each chapter had its own .txt file. For Spanish, the ElevenLabs API was used in order to programmatically generate audio Bibles. For Chinese, Amazon Poly was used as ElevenLabs did not have a Chinese model at the time of this project. A basic quality assessment was run on all audio that alerts users to potentially problematic audio files. This significantly reduces the time spent on the overall quality assurance process. Finally, the audio files were brought into Adobe Audition. Here, the audio was slowed, volume increased, and other edits were made as necessary in order to produce higher quality and consistency across audio files.
